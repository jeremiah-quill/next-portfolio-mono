          I'm a self-taught developer with a wide range of skills across the stack and a passion for
          learning. I recently graduated from a full stack bootcamp offered by UPenn where I was
          able to refine my skills and experience working as part of a team.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          My background is in finance and accounting, specifically in the corporate real estate
          industry, which has given me invaluable experience as a professional. I am organized, work
          well on my own or as part of a team, and understand how to manage to a deadline.
          <br></br>

          That's my son, Remi, you see over there. He's a cool little dude. I want to show him as he
          grows up that it's never too late to re-invent yourself and find success in your passions.
          That's why I continue to grind every day to improve as a developer.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          I'm currently available for freelance opportunities, contract roles, or full time
          positions. Please reach out @jcq5010@gmail.com, I would love to hear from you!
